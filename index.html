   <h1 id="header1">The Life of Charles Babbage</h1>
    <p id="p1"> Charles Babbage was born in London England on December 26th 1791. His early life began as any normal teenager, studying at Cambridge University. He transfered from the school to Peterhouse college, taking a different approach. After graduating in 1814, he enlisted in the Royal Institustion. He was elected in the Institustion 2 years later in 1816. Charles greatly influenced the founding of the Royal Institustion which originally, strived to make astronomical calculations easier to read for the public. Charles recalculated and simplified many of the advanced astronomical problems for many years. As he did this for many years, using his knowledge he created a mechanical computer which will be talked about in the next paragraph. After almost 30 years of working on this, Charles Babbage died in his London home on the 18th of October, 1871. </p>
   <h2 id="header2">Babbage and his computers</h2>
    <p id="p2">Charles Babbage designed and made one of the first mechanical computers, capable of doing basic astronomical equations. One of his most popular designs is the difference engine, which was developed in the 1820s. The difference engine was mainly used for polynomial functions by calculating different values. In 1847, roughly 20 years later Babbage decided to design a difference engine 2. The difference engine 2 would do the function of the original design, but more accurately and precise. The difference engine 2 was never made although several decades later in 2002 the Science Museum constructed a replica based on the original blueprints. In the end, Babbage gave the scientific community a great tool and developed some of the first computers</p><br>
